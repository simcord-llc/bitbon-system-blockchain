## Bitbon System Blockchain

Official implementation of the Bitbon System Blockchain based on [Ethereum codebase](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/).

Owner: **[Simcord-LLC](https://www.simcord.com/)**


## Building the source

Building `bitbon_node` binary requires both a Go (version 1.14 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. 

Also you need to install some libs.
Ubuntu example:
```
sudo apt install make g++ gcc musl-dev gmpc-dev libmpfr-dev
```

Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make clean build
```

## Running `bitbon_node`

Bitbon node runs with command line parameters which Ethereum uses. To see Ethereum parameters - ethereum see cli wiki [CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options)

### Programmatically interfacing `bitbon_node` nodes

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

* `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
* `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
* `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
* `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
* `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
* `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
* `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
* `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
* `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
* `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
* `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
* `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
* `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `bitbon_node` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

### Operating a network

To use bitbon node - please use `--network` parameter for setting your private network.

#### Defining the private genesis state

First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be
aware of and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": {CHAINID},
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip160Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "maxGenDAGBlock": 0,
    "cposBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock":0,
    "unlimitedCodeSizeBlock": 0,
    "istanbulBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0,
    "quorum": {
      "period": {PERIOD},
      "epoch": {EPOCH},
      "initialSigners": ["{ADDR_MINER}"],
      "initialHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
      "start": {START}
    }
  },
  "alloc": {},
  "nonce": "0x0000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "0x00",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "extraData": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c46eae38e2ab01f91de7afff3097596dfff0c49366acc38944b6f36284dde66f9d6ae7cbb16f5e740000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "gasLimit": "0xFFFFFFFFFF",
  "difficulty": "0x00",
  "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```
where:
* {CHAINID} - integer value, you network identification
* {PERIOD} - integer value, block mining interval (in seconds)
* {EPOCH} - integer value, number of seconds for every epoch
* {START} - integer value, unix timestamp (seconds) for marking CPOS consencus start time
* {ADDR_MINER} - miner address, from input parameters --miner.etherbase

The above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we'd recommend changing
the `nonce` to some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able
to connect to you. If you'd like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, create
the accounts and populate the `alloc` field with their addresses.

```json
"alloc": {
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {
    "balance": "111111111"
  },
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": {
    "balance": "222222222"
  }
}
```

With the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you'll need to initialize **every**
`bitbon_node` node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly
set:

```shell
$ bitbon_node init path/to/genesis.json
```

# Example how to run
## Compile binary
```make clean build```
## Create genesis.json file like this
```

    "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
    "timestamp": "0x00",
